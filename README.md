<!-- ### Creating a release

This repo uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage
versioning and changelogs. This means you shouldn't need to manually change of
the internal package versions.

Before opening a PR, run `yarn changeset` and follow the prompts to describe the
changes you've made. This will create a changeset file that should be committed.

As changesets are committed to the `main` branch, the [changesets github
action](https://github.com/changesets/action) in the release workflow will
automatically keep track of the pending `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`
updates in an open PR titled `chore: version packages`.

Once this PR is merged, the release workflow will be triggered, creating new
tags and github releases, and publishing the updated packages to NPM. **These
PRs should be carefully reviewed!** -->
